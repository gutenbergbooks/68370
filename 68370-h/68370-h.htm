<p class="dropcap">A tiny spot on the map is the Philistia of Old
Testament days—a way station on the path of
commerce between alphabet-building Phœnicia to
the north, and Canaan and predatory Arabia on the
south. But long before those hardy neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
plagued Israel and made a hostage of the Ark of the
Covenant there were Philistines in the world, influencing
its destinies.</p>

<p>Tradition has been unkind to Philistinism as to
many other good things. The Serpent in the Garden
is the earliest embodiment of the genius of protest,
unless we follow John Milton farther back to the
rebellion in the Court of Heaven, organized by the
Sons of the Morning. Omnipotence that founded
order set in motion change also. The unrest that is
the electro-motor of progress is in nature as in man,
and evolution is its perpetual law.</p>

<p>Human society was ripe for Philistines when Noah
launched his ocean palace inland. Scarce a century
later the egotism of man sought to scale high heaven
from a tower of brick and asphalt. Matter was
deified with the usual result, and a discordant medley
of alien labor was all the product of the giant
enterprise.</p>

<p>Down through the patriarchal ages the conservative
men who builded cities and the sons of progress
who balked established order and moved on kept up
the alternation of forces. Jacob wrung from an
angel his divine endowment and won his brother’s
primogeniture when Esau, the conservative, gave all
the future for the good things near by. Joseph, the
dreamer, peddled like old clothes to a rag man,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
showed his thrifty brothers a bunco trick worth learning
when he had come, a stranger of a despised
race, to be all but a Pharaoh in the capital of civilization.
The trumpet blasts that felled Jericho, the
vanquishing shouts of Gideon, the sling of the shepherd
stripling that freed a nation, tell of seemingly
inadequate means out of the conservative order that
changed history. Moses, prophet and lawgiver and
priest, killed his man and was a fugitive a generation
before he abandoned his princely rank in Egypt to
lead a nation of slaves into the evolution of independence
and mastery of the world’s spiritual
thought.</p>

<p>The ancient monarchies went to wreck when the
social order had become stationary—encrusted with
custom and caste. But a few Philistines, destroyers
of arbitrary ranks, recreated the world in the democracy
of Chivalry, and that in turn went down when
its vital purpose had been achieved and its orders had
become set and stifled progress.</p>

<p>It was a Philistine, a despised player and holder
of horses, who gave the modern world its literature.
It was a heretic monk who threw ink-stands, not
only at Satan, but at embodied and enthroned religion,
who gave the modern world its impetus to
freedom. The imaginative authors who most strongly
sway mankind today are Philistines. Thackeray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
smilingly lifted the mask from aristocracy and exposed
its sordid servility. Dickens threw down the
idols of pretentious respectability. Hugo taught the
democracy of virtue. Tolstoi dethroned convention
in religion. Ibsen divorced morality from law.</p>

<p>The note of protest resounds throughout history.
Every age seeks in material gratifications the realization
of its destiny. Everywhere genius becomes
conservative and sterile; art grows self-conscious
and measures achievement by technical difficulties;
ceremonial binds social life; law protects artificial
privilege; religion is refined into theology or materialized
into idolatry; hospitality becomes an exchange,
and the humanities are buried alive under
their own machinery. They who protest, who exalt
purpose and measure achievement thereby, are called
Philistines.</p>

<p>They realize the finiteness of all created things.
They see evolution in all, and hold naught that is
finite to be final.</p>

<p>Philistinism is the world’s perpetual crusade. It
reveres tradition, but it despises commonplace in
purple.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ENGLISH_MONUMENTS">ENGLISH MONUMENTS.</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-e.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">England relegates her poets to a “Corner.”
The earth and the fullness thereof belongs to
the men who can kill; on this rock have her State
and Church been built.</p>

<p>As the tourist approaches the city of London for
the first time there are four monuments that probably
will attract his attention. They lift themselves out
of the fog and smoke and soot, and seem to struggle
toward the blue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>One of these monuments is to commemorate a
calamity—the conflagration of 1666—and the others
are in honor of deeds of war.</p>

<p>The finest memorial in St. Paul’s is to a certain
Irishman, Albert Wellesley, Duke of Wellington.
The mines and quarries of earth have been called
on for the richest contributions; and talent and skill
have given their all to produce this enduring work of
beauty that tells posterity of the mighty acts of this
mighty man. The rare richness and lavish beauty of
the Wellington mausoleum is only surpassed by that
of a certain tomb in France.</p>

<p>As an exploiter the Corsican overdid the thing a
bit—so the world arose and put him down; but
safely dead his shade can boast a grave so sumptuous
that Englishmen in Paris refuse to look upon it.</p>

<p>But England need not be ashamed. Her land is
spiked with glittering monuments to greatness gone.
And on these monuments you often get the epitomized
life of the man whose dust lies below.</p>

<p>On the carved marble to Lord Cornwallis I read
that “He defeated the Americans with great
slaughter.” And so, wherever in England I see a
beautiful monument I know that probably the inscription
will tell how “he defeated” somebody. And
one grows to the belief that, while woman’s glory is
her hair, man’s glory is to defeat someone. And if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
he can “defeat with great slaughter” his monument
is twice as high as if he had only visited on his brother
man a plain defeat. In truth I am told by a friend
who has a bias for statistics, that all monuments
above fifty feet high in England, are to men who
have defeated other men “with great slaughter.”
The only exceptions to this rule are the Albert Memorial,
which is a tribute of wifely affection rather than
a public testimonial, so therefore need not be considered
here, and a monument to a worthy brewer who
died and left three hundred thousand pound to charity.
I mentioned this fact to my friend, but he unhorsed me
by declaring that modesty forbade carving truth on
the monument, yet it was a fact that the brewer, too,
had brought defeat to vast numbers and had, like
Saul, slaughtered his thousands.</p>

<p>When I visited the site of the Globe Theater and
found thereon a brewery whose shares are warranted
to make the owner rich beyond the dream of avarice,
I was depressed. In my boyhood I had supposed
that if ever I should reach this spot where Shakespeare’s
plays were first produced I should see a
beautiful park and a splendid monument; while
some white-haired old patriarch would greet me and
give a little lecture to the assembled pilgrims on the
great man whose footsteps had made sacred the soil
beneath our feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>But there is no park, no monument and no white-haired
old poet to give you welcome—only a brewery.</p>

<p>“Aye, mon, but ain’t ut a big ’un?” protested
an Englishman who heard my murmurs.</p>

<p>Yes, yes, we must be truthful. It is a big brewery,
and there are four big bulldogs in the court way; and
there are big vats; and big workmen in big aprons.
And each of these workmen is allowed to drink six
quarts of beer each day without charge, which proves
that the true Christian spirit is not dead. Then there
are big horses that draw the big wagons and on the
corner is a big tap room where the thirsty are served
with big glasses.</p>

<p>The founder of this brewery became very rich;
and if my statistical friend is right, the owners of
these mighty vats have defeated mankind “with
great slaughter.”</p>

<p>We have seen that although Napoleon, the
defeated, has a more gorgeous tomb than Wellington,
who defeated him, yet there is consolation in the
thought that although England has no monument to
Shakespeare, he now has the freedom of Elysium;
while the present address of the British worthies,
who have battened and fattened on poor humanity’s
thirst for strong drink since Samuel Johnson was
executor of Thrale’s estate, is unknown.</p>

<p>We have this on the authority of a Spirit Medium,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
who says: “The virtues essential and peculiar to
the exalted station of the British worthy debars
the unfortunate possessor from entering Paradise.
There is not a Lord Chancellor, or Lord Mayor, or
Lord of the Chamber, or Master of the Hounds, or
Beefeater in Ordinary, or any sort of British bigwig
out of the whole of British Beadledom, upon which
the sun never sets, in Elysium. This is the only
dignity beyond their reach.”</p>

<p>This Mejum is an honorable person, and I am sure
he would not make this assertion if he did not have
proof of the facts. So for the present we will allow
him to go on his own recognizance, believing that he
will adduce his documents at the proper time.</p>

<p>But still should not England have a fitting monument
to Shakespeare? He is her one universal
citizen. His name is honored in every school or
college of earth where books are prized. There is
no scholar in any clime who is not his debtor.</p>

<p>He was born in England, he was never out of
England, his ashes rest in England.</p>

<p>But England’s Budget has never been ballasted
with a single pound to help preserve inviolate the
memory of her one son to whom the world uncovers.</p>

<p>Victor Hugo has said something on this subject
about like this:</p>

<p>Why a monument to Shakespeare? He is his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
monument and England is its pedestal. Shakespeare
has no need of a pyramid; he has his work.</p>

<p>What can bronze or marble do for him? Malachite
and alabaster are of no avail. Jasper, serpentine,
basalt, porphyry, granite; stones from Paros and
marble from Carrara—they are all a waste of pains;
genius can do without them.</p>

<p>What is as indestructible as these: <i>The Tempest</i>,
<i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, <i>Coriolanus</i>?
What monument sublimer than <i>Lear</i>, sterner than
<i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, more dazzling than <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, more amazing than <i>Richard III</i>?</p>

<p>What moon could shed about the pile a light more
mystic than that of <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>?
What capital, were it even in London, could rumble
around it as tumultuously as Macbeth’s perturbed
soul? What framework of cedar or oak will last as
long as <i>Othello</i>? What bronze can equal the bronze
of <i>Hamlet</i>?</p>

<p>No construction of lime, of rock, of iron and of
cement is worth the deep breath of genius, which is
the respiration of God through man. What edifice
can equal thought? Babel is less lofty than Isaiah;
Cheops is smaller than Homer; the Colosseum is
inferior to Juvenal; the Giralda at Seville is dwarfed
by the side of Cervantes; St. Peter’s at Rome does
not reach to the ankle of Dante.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>What architect has the skill to build a tower so
high as the name of Shakespeare? Add anything if
you can to mind! Then why a monument to
Shakespeare?</p>

<p>I answer, Not for the glory of Shakespeare, but
for the honor of England!</p>

<p class="dropcap">I doff my hat to <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> and hail it
“Brother well met.”</p>

<p>In the name of all who have hated shams, in the
name of all brave knights whose lances have shivered
against the dead walls of human stupidity, ignorance,
malice and convention; in the name of every stifled
and unuttered song that should have mounted like
a meadow lark’s to heaven; in the name of every
pilloried hope and dead ambition killed in the long
battle with the Mediocrities and the Banalities
greet thee, Knight Errant from Philistia, and bid
thee God speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>And having,“hailed,” and “bade,” and “greeted,”
let me say that though the world is wide and shams
are many, and the race, to the swift usually, and the
fight to the strong almost always, and though the
God of battle, is according to Napoleon, whom it is
fashionable to quote “on the side of the big battalions,”
yet strong blows for truth are cumulative and
<span class="smcap">The Philistine’s</span> bright blade must be dyed often
with the blood of Error ere it be sheathed and every
lie sooner or later driven to its sure end of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>I will not hail you Reformer, for that old and honorable
name like that older and still more honorable
one of “gentleman” has fallen recently into disrepute
and at last reports was still falling; besides
reformers are often failures, and too often after a
brief career are found taking tea with the Mammon
of Unrighteousness, having assumed their discarded
role originally rather for “what there was in it,”
than from exalted or high-minded motives or to improve
the condition of their respective healths.</p>

<p>A young man called once on the great Voltaire,
and besought his encouragement in projects he had
conceived for a reorganized and better scheme
of human society, The philosopher leaned his
head upon his hand and thought a minute,
then rising, led the way to an inner room, where,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
against the velvet-hung wall, was an ivory figure
of the Redeemer on the cross; he pointed to it with
warning forefinger. “Young man,” he said, “behold
the fate of a reformer.”</p>

<p>When I see the little things many men strive and
cavil over and the great ones they disregard or ignore
I know that the kingdom of Liliput was not a figment
of the imagination of the genial Swift but a
lesson from real life. And when I consider how
they swarm like water-bugs and quarrel over the
pronunciation of words and bicker with their
neighbor to make him or her use the sharp “a” in
“squalor” so as to make it “squaylor,” I think sensible
people might be excused for weeping or even
swearing.</p>

<p>Little people these, say I, and I would wager a
dollar to nothing that William Dean Howells is their
prophet and that they all venerate his works.</p>

<p>The mere fact that Howells is, is a proof that there
are those who want Howells besides himself, and
while not entirely subscribing to the saying that
“whatever is is best,” it must be recognized that it
has its <i>raison d’être</i>, and we all know Howells has
his readers or he would not have his publishers.</p>

<p>One can almost tell what a man’s opinions will be
by knowing what he reads or has read, just as I
once heard it said of a tuft-hunting editor that it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
could be predicated with absolute certainty what
position he would take on a public question by learning
with whom he walked down town in the morning
or with what wealthy parvenu he passed the previous
evening. This is but a modern application of
the old saw, “a man is known by the company he
keeps,” and mentally he may be known by the books
he reads or the magazines he skims through. I
shudder for Richard Watson Gilder, John Brisben
Walker, E. Bok, and others of the Mutual Admiration
Society style of periodical makers if they are to
be believed to keep the company or read the lucubrations
of the contributors to the dreary masses of
illustrated inanities they edit, publications which have
claims to interest, based alone upon the merit of their
illustrations and the perfection of their typographical
beauty.</p>

<p>But to recur to the line of romance and digress
from the magazines which need so much attention,
and from “Bartley” and the other counter jumping
namby-pamby, goody-goodies of the Howells stripe,
including his own weary history of himself, and the
“Books Which Most Influence Him,” the baleful
effects of which are legitimately and plainly perceptible
in his works. There are shams in literature
more dreadful than Mr. Howells, who is a turgid
fact and no sham. For instance;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>I know of one evanescently popular young creature
who chronically contributes to the magazines,
whose mother it is said, writes his tales which, she
being a clever woman and he an uncommonly stupid
man, appears credible to say the least; and there is
another “man” I am told of whose sister is said to
write his poems and modestly efface herself, and as
the stories are good and the poems fairly readable, it
should be the part of <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> to disclose to
the world the real authors and chastise these and
other shams, for shams are the hardest hurdles in the
steeplechase which Truth has to make in this world,
since they substitute the false for the real and crown
the fool with the laurels of the genius.</p>

<p>How much more might be said of the tasks you
have to accomplish, brave <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> with your
brawny arm and your good naked sword! So much
that the very thought of it fatigues one and that, hailing
you as the latest and best contestant in the tourney
of Knighthood and yet, considering you as a publication
in an embryonic stage, I am compelled to
quote these lovely lines of Longfellow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, little feet that such long years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Must wander through this vale of tears,</div>

<h2 class="nobreak hanging allsmcap" id="SIDE_TALKS_WITH_THE_PHILISTINES">SIDE TALKS WITH THE PHILISTINES:
BEING SUNDRY BITS OF
WISDOM WHICH HAVE BEEN
HERETOFORE SECRETED, AND ARE NOW
SET FORTH IN PRINT. <img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /></h2>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is a land of free speech, Philistia, and if one of
us chooses to make remarks concerning the work of
the others no sense of modesty keeps us quiet. It is
because we cannot say what we would in the periodicals
which are now issued in a dignified, manner in
various places, that we have made this book. In the
afore-mentioned periodicals divers men chatter with
great fluency, startling regularity and “damnable
complacency,” each through his individual bonnet.
Edward W. Bok, evidently assisted by Mrs. Lydia
Pinkham and W. L. Douglas, of Brocton, Massachusetts,
prints the innermost secrets of dead women
told by their living male relatives for six dollars a
column. Thereby the authors are furnished with
the price of a week’s board, and those of us who
may have left some little sense of decency, wonder
what manner of man it may be who sells his wife’s
heart to the readers of Bok. But the “unspeakable
Bok” is “successful.” His magazine flourishes like
a green bay tree. Many readers write him upon
subjects of deportment and other matters in which
he is accomplished. So, the gods give us joy! Let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
him drive on, and may his <i>Home Journal</i> have five
million readers before the year is out—God help
them!</p>

<p>Mr. Gilder dishes up monthly beautifully printed
articles which nobody cares about, but which everybody
buys, because <i>The Century</i> looks well on the
library table.</p>

<p>Mr. Howells maunders weekly in a column called
“Life and Letters” in Harper’s journal of civilization.
This “Life and Letters” reminds me of the
Peterkin’s famous picnic at Strawberry Nook.
“There weren’t any strawberries and there wasn’t
any nook, but there was a good place to tie the
horses.”</p>

<p>So it goes through the whole list. There are
people, however, who believe that Romance is not
dead, and that there is literature to be made which
is neither inane nor yet smells of the kitchen sink.
This is a great big merry world, says Mr. Dana, and
there’s much good to be got out of it, so toward
those who believe as we do—we of Philistia—this
paper starts upon its great and perilous voyage at one
dollar a year.</p>

<p>It was Balzac, or some one else, who used to tell of
a flea that lived on a mangy lion and boasted to all
the rank outside fleas that he met: I have in me the
blood of the King of Beasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is a comforting thought that somewhere, at some
time, every good thing on earth is brought to an
accounting of itself. Thereby are the children of
men saved from much tyranny. For the good things
of earth are your true oppressors.</p>

<p>For such an accounting are Philistines born in
every age. By their audit are men perpetually set
free from trammels self-woven.</p>

<p>Earnest men have marvelled in all times that
convention has imputed to husks and symbols the
potency of the things they outwardly stand for.
Many also have protested, and these, in reproach,
have been called Philistines. And yet they have
done no more than show forth that in all things the
vital purpose is more than the form that shrines it.
The inspirations of to-day are the shams of to-morrow—for
the purpose has departed and only the
dead form of custom remains. “Is not the body
more than raiment”—and is not life more than the
formulæ that hedge it in?</p>

<p>Wherefore men who do their own thinking, and
eke women betimes, take honor rather than disparagement
in the name which is meant to typify remorseless
commonplace. They hesitate not to question
custom, whether there be reason in it. They
ask “Why?” when one makes proclamation:</p>

<p>“Lo! Columbus discovered America four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
years ago! Let us give a dance.” There have
been teachers who sought to persuade mankind that
use alone is beauty—and these too have done violence
to the fitness of things. On such ideals is the
civilization of Cathay founded. Neither in the grossness
of material things nor in the false refinements
that “divorce the feeling from its mate the deed”
is the core and essence of living.</p>

<p>It is the business of the true Philistine to rescue
from the environment of custom and ostentation the
beauty and the goodness cribbed therein. And so
the Philistines of these days, whose prime type is the
Knight of La Mancha, go tilting at windmills and
other fortresses—often on sorry nags and with shaky
lances, and yet on heroic errand bent. And to such
merry joust and fielding all lovers of chivalry are
bidden: to look on—perhaps to laugh, it may be to
grieve at a woeful belittling of lofty enterprise.
Come, such of you as have patience with such warriors.
It is Sancho Panza who invites you.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>The Chip-Munk</i> has a bright reference in the issue
of May 15 to Coventry, Patmore, Pater and Meredith.
These are four great men, as <i>The Chip-Munk</i>
boldly states.</p>

<p><i>The Chip-Munk</i> further announces that the Only
Original Lynx-Eyed Proof Reader has not gone on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
journey. Really, I supposed of course he had been
gone these many moons!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mark Twain says he is writing “Joan of Arc”
anonymously in <i>Harper’s</i> because he is convinced if
he signed it the people would insist the stuff was
funny. Mr. Twain is worried unnecessarily. It has
been a long time since any one insisted the matter he
turns out so voluminously was or is funny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The amusing William Dean Howells writes that he
is so bothered by autograph seekers that he will hereafter
refuse to send his signature “with a sentiment”
unless the applicant for his favor produces satisfactory
evidence he has read all of his works, “now some
thirty or forty in number.” When this proof has
been sent if Mr. Howells does not return his autograph
on the bottom of a check for a large amount,
he deserves to be arrested for cruelty to his fellows.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> There is no doubt that a teacher once committed
to a certain line of thought will cling to that line
long after all others have deserted it. In trying to
persuade others he convinces himself. This is especially
so if he is opposed. Opposition evolves in his
mind a maternal affection for the product of his
brain and he defends it blindly to the death. Thus
we see why institutions are so conservative. Like
the coral insect they secrete osseous matter; and
when a preacher preaches he himself always goes
forward to the mourners’ bench and accepts all of
the dogmas that have just been so ably stated.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Literature is the noblest of all the arts. Music
dies on the air, or at best exists only as a memory;
oratory ceases with the effort; the painter’s colors
fade and the canvas rots; the marble is dragged
from its pedestal and is broken into fragments; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> is as naught, and the books
burned by the fires of the <i>auto da fe</i> still live. Literature
is reproduced ten thousand times ten thousand
and lodges its appeal with posterity. It dedicates
itself to Time.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The action of various theatrical managers in cutting
from their programmes the name of the author
of the plays running at their houses and the similar
action of numerous librarians in withdrawing his
books from their shelves is simply another proof of
the marvellous powers of stultification possessed by
the humans of the present time. These managers,
having the scattering wits of birds, do not seem to
appreciate that, whatever the character of the author,
the plays he has written were as bad before they
were produced as they are now that he has been so
effectually extinguished; and these librarians cannot
comprehend, evidently, that his books were fully as
immoral as they are now when they were first put on
the shelves. Would it not be a refreshing thing to
find a theatrical manager who managed a theater because
he had an honest purpose of elevating, perpetuating,
purifying and strengthening the drama,
instead of speculating in it as a Jew speculates in old
clothes? And would it not be a marvel to discover
librarian who knew something about books?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Buffalo, New York, is getting to be very classic in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
some things. It tolerated the nude with great
equanimity in the recent Art Exhibition and exhibits
the female embodiment of everything ideal, from the
German muse of song to the still more German muse
of barley products, at the great variety of fests, more
or less related to beer, that follow in swift succession
in that town. But the classic climax was reached on
Good Friday of this year, when the Venus of Milo,
mounted on a Bock beer pedestal, was the center
piece of an Easter symbol picture in a Hebrew clothing
advertisement. The limit of Buffalo congruity
seems to have been reached.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>The Chip-Munk</i> for May has a bit of folk-lore
about a man who advised another to join a conspiracy
of silence. This item appeared in 1893 and during
1894 was published by actual count in one hundred
and forty-nine newspapers. The editors of
<i>The Chip-Munk</i> are a bit slow in reading their exchanges.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The Two Orphans at the Kate Claxton Building,
Chicago Stockyards, have a motto on their letter
heads that reads, “We are the people and wisdom
will die with us.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The editor of <i>The Baseburner</i>, who claims to be a
veritist, states that it is not true that the Garland
stoves were named after Ham Garland of Chicago<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
Stockyards; but the fact is Garland named himself
after the stoves.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>Current Literature</i> recently had a long article on
Louise Imogene Guinly. Doubtless the spelling of
the name was a typographical error, as the editor
probably refers to Miss Louisa Imogene Quinney,
who is postmistress at Auburn, New York, and
daughter of Richard Quinney, manufacturer of the
famous Quinney Mineral Water.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Judge Robert Grant has in preparation a series of
articles called “How to Live on a Million a Minute
and Have Money to Burn.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I hear the voice of the editors of <i>The Chip-Munk</i>
complaining that <i>Little Journeys</i>, <i>The Bibelot</i>, <i>Chips</i>
and other publications are base, would-be imitators
of their own chaste periodical. Why, you sweet
things, did you know that many hundred years ago a
great printer made a book which was printed in black
inside with a cover in red and black. I believe this
is the thing which you claim is original with yourselves.
So far as the rest of the periodicals are
concerned I have no means of knowing whether they
are imitations or not, but <i>Little Journeys</i> was in type
and printed long before <i>The Chip-Munk</i> came out
of its hole.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Messrs. Copeland &amp; Day of Boston recently published<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
for Mr. Stephen Crane a book which he called
“The Black Riders.” I don’t know why; the
riders might have as easily been green or yellow or
baby-blue for all the book tells about them, and I
think the title, “The Pink Rooters,” would have
been better, but it doesn’t matter. My friend, The
Onlooker, of <i>Town Topics</i>, quotes one of the verses
and says this, which I heartily endorse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I saw a man pursuing the horizon;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round and round they sped.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I was disturbed at this;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I accosted the man.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“It is futile,” I said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“You can never”——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“You lie,” he cried.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ran on.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This was Mr. Howells proving that Ibsen is valuable
and interesting. It is to be hoped that Mr.
Crane will write another poem about him after his
legs have been worn off.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I was moved to read Mr. Hermann Sudermann’s
diverting novel, “The Wish,” upon observing an extended
notice in the “Sub Rosa” column of the
Buffalo <i>Courier</i>. The writer therein alleged that
the novel taught a great moral lesson, and desiring
to be taught a great moral lesson I bought the book.
It treats of the wish of a girl for her sister’s death in
order that she might marry the husband. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the great moral truth is that one should not wish for
such things, but I supposed that had been taught in
one of the Commandments, which tells of coveting
thy neighbor’s wife, and my Sunday School teacher
used to tell me that it referred equally to husbands.
I was evidently mistaken, and Hermann Sudermann
is hereby hailed as a teacher of morals. I should
think, from the style of the “Sub Rosa” article,
that the writer is a woman. If she is, I’ll bet her
feet are cold if she enjoys such things as this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>When Old Hellinger entered the gable room he
saw a sight which froze the blood in his veins. His
son’s body lay stretched on the ground. As he fell
he must have clutched the supports of the bier on
which the dead girl had been placed, and dragged
down the whole erection with him; for on the top of
him, between the broken planks, lay the corpse, in
its long, white shroud, its motionless face upon his
face, its bared arms thrown over his head. At this
moment he regained consciousness, and started up.
The dead girl’s head sank down from his and bumped
on the floor.</p>
</div>

<p>This cheerful book is translated from the German
by Lily Henkel and published by the Appletons. I
commend it to Mr. Bliss Carman and his shroud
washers.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mr. Thomas B. Mosher, of Portland, Maine,
deserves the thanks of the reading public for the
issuing of <i>The Bibelot</i>. Each month this dainty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
periodical comes like a dash of salt water on a hot
day, and is as refreshing. After reading the longings
and the heartburnings of the various degenerates who
inflict their stuff on us these days, Mr. Mosher’s
“Sappho” comes and makes us really believe that
there is a man up on the coast of Maine who has the
salt of the sea and the breath of the pines in him, and
is willing to think that there are other people who
care for purity and sweetness, rather than such literature
as “Vistas” and the plays of Maeterlinck.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> When in five consecutive stories, printed in the
same periodical, the hero or heroine has ended the
narrative by shooting himself or herself, is it not
about time to hire somebody to invent some other
denouement?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Many a man’s reputation would not know his
character if they met on the street.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> To be stupid when inclined and dull when you
wish is a boon that only goes with high friendship.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Every man has moments when he doubts his ability.
So does every woman at times doubt her wit
and beauty and long to see them mirrored in a masculine
eye. This is why flattery is acceptable. A
woman will doubt everything you say except it be
compliments to herself—here she believes you truthful
and mentally admires you for your discernment.</p>

<h3>THE MAGAZINES.</h3>

<p><i>Kate Field’s Wash</i> is dry.</p>

<p><i>The Arena</i> has sand.</p>

<p>“Sub-Tragic” is the latest description of Vic.
Woodhull’s <i>Humanitarian</i>.</p>

<p><i>McClure’s</i> is getting a little weary with its living
pictures.</p>

<p><i>Scribner’s</i> has a thrilling article on “Books We
Have Published.”</p>

<p><i>Godey’s</i> is very gay in its second childhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Judge Tourgee’s <i>Basis</i> isn’t business. “It’s pretty,
but it isn’t war.”</p>

<p><i>The Century</i>, it is said, will insert a page or two of
reading matter between the Italian art and the ads.</p>

<p><i>The Basis</i> is out with prizes for poets and sermon
writers. It was as certain as the law of nature makes
the filling of every vacuum at some time, that somewhere
and at some time these people would get their
reward. It seems to be coming now. But where
and when will be the reward of the people who read
what they write? The thought of their fate is all
shuddery.</p>

<p>Ginger used to be in evidence in magazines and
pumpkin pies. Squash is a prominent ingredient
now.</p>

<p>If <i>Peterson’s</i> wouldn’t mix ads. and reading matter
in their books and on title pages the cause of current
literature would be advanced.</p>

<p>Between Grant’s essays on the art of living and
the mild satire of “The Point of View,” it really
looks as if the Tattler had come again—a little disembodied
for Dick Steele, but in character.</p>
